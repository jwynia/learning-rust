# Active Learning Context

## Current Focus
- Concept: Project organization and learning path planning
- Project: Setting up Rust learning environment and experiment structure
- Resources: The Rust Programming Language Book, The Cargo Book

## Recent Progress
- Added offline copies of The Rust Programming Language Book and The Cargo Book to the docs folder for reference (3/31/2025)
- Created structured experiments folder with categories for different application types (3/31/2025)
- Organized learning path from CLI apps to packages/libraries to web apps to desktop/mobile apps
- Key insight: Organizing experiments by application type rather than language concepts is more efficient for experienced developers

## Current Challenges
- Struggling with [specific concept]
- Error pattern: [Common error you're encountering]
- Environment issue: [Any tooling/environment problems]
- Question: [Specific question you're trying to answer]

## Next Steps
- Begin with first CLI application experiment
- Read chapters 1-3 in The Rust Programming Language Book
- Set up Rust development environment (rustc, cargo, etc.)
- Create first basic CLI application
- Document learning progress in memory bank

## Notes from Last Session
- [Important takeaways from your last learning session]
- [Questions that came up]
- [Things to remember for next time]

## Learning Effectiveness
- What's working well: [Effective learning strategies]
- What needs adjustment: [Learning approaches to modify]
- Time spent this week: [Hours]
- Progress vs. expectations: [On track / ahead / behind]

## Current Code Snippets
```rust
// Example of current code you're working with
fn example() -> Result<(), String> {
    // Comments about what you're trying to accomplish
    // or what's confusing
    Ok(())
}
```

## Session Plan
- Today's goal: [What you want to accomplish in this session]
- Time allocation: [How you'll divide your time]
- Success criteria: [How you'll know if the session was successful]
