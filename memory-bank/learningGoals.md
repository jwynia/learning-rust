# Rust Learning Goals

## Overall Purpose
- Why I want to learn Rust (systems programming, career advancement, hobby projects, etc.)
- How I plan to apply Rust knowledge (specific domains or projects)
- Time commitment I can allocate to learning

## Learning Milestones

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Estimated time: X weeks)
- Set up Rust development environment
- Learn basic syntax and programming concepts
- Complete "The Rust Book" chapters 1-9
- Build 2-3 small CLI applications
- Success criteria: Comfortable with basic Rust syntax and the ownership model

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Estimated time: X weeks)
- Master generics, traits, and lifetimes
- Learn effective error handling
- Understand the module system and dependencies
- Build a medium-complexity project with tests
- Success criteria: Can build maintainable Rust applications with good architecture

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Estimated time: X weeks)
- Learn concurrency in Rust
- Explore unsafe Rust where appropriate
- Understand performance optimization
- Integrate Rust with other languages
- Success criteria: Can build high-performance, safe, concurrent applications

## Project Ideas
- Project 1: [Description of starter project]
- Project 2: [Description of intermediate project]
- Project 3: [Description of advanced project]

## Learning Resources
- Primary: The Rust Programming Language book (offline copy available in docs/rust-programming-language-book/)
- Secondary: Rust By Example
- Reference: The Cargo Book (offline copy available in docs/cargo-book/), [Other books, courses, or websites I plan to use]
- Community: [Forums, Discord servers, or local meetups I'll participate in]

## Challenges & Mitigation
- Expected challenge 1: [e.g., "Understanding ownership"] - Mitigation: [e.g., "Additional exercises and examples"]
- Expected challenge 2: [e.g., "Finding time to practice consistently"] - Mitigation: [e.g., "Schedule 3 sessions per week"]

## Success Definition
I will consider my Rust learning journey successful when:
- [Specific criteria for what success looks like to you]
- [Specific projects or capabilities you want to achieve]
- [How you'll know when you've "learned enough" Rust for your goals]
