# Rust Project Progress

## Completed Projects
- Learning Environment Setup
  - Description: Created structured experiments folder for Rust learning journey
  - Goal: Organize learning path and create a framework for progressive skill development
  - Key features: 
    - Categorized by application type (CLI, libraries, web, desktop/mobile)
    - Progressive complexity within each category
    - Shared components section for cross-cutting concerns
  - Concepts applied: Project organization, learning path planning
  - Code repository: /Users/jwynia/Projects/learning-rust/experiments
  - Challenges overcome: Balancing concept-based vs. application-based organization
  - What you'd do differently: [reflections to be added as learning progresses]

## Planned Projects
- Basic CLI Application
  - Description: Simple command-line tool demonstrating Rust fundamentals
  - Goal: Learn basic Rust syntax, ownership model, and CLI argument handling
  - Prerequisites: Rust installation and development environment setup
  - Features planned: Command-line argument parsing, file I/O, basic error handling
  - Expected challenges: Understanding ownership and borrowing concepts
  - Resources needed: Offline copies of The Rust Programming Language Book and The Cargo Book, clap or structopt crate documentation

- Interactive CLI Application
  - Description: Terminal-based interactive application with user input handling
  - Goal: Learn more advanced Rust patterns and interactive UI concepts
  - Prerequisites: Basic Rust syntax and CLI development
  - Features planned: Interactive prompts, progress indicators, persistent state
  - Expected challenges: Handling user input safely, managing application state
  - Resources needed: dialoguer and indicatif crate documentation

- Basic Library Package
  - Description: Reusable Rust library with well-defined API
  - Goal: Learn Rust module system, API design, and documentation
  - Prerequisites: Solid understanding of Rust fundamentals
  - Features planned: Public API, comprehensive documentation, unit tests
  - Expected challenges: Designing ergonomic APIs with Rust's ownership system
  - Resources needed: Rust documentation on crates and modules

## Project Ideas
- CLI file processing utility (Medium complexity)
- REST API with database integration (High complexity)
- Cross-platform GUI application (High complexity)
- WebAssembly module for browser integration (Medium complexity)
- Systems programming tool with FFI bindings (High complexity)
