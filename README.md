# Structured Rust Learning Journey

A comprehensive, structured approach to learning Rust programming language through progressive experiments and detailed documentation.

## Project Overview

This repository documents a methodical journey of learning Rust, organized to facilitate a progressive skill-building path from basic to advanced concepts. It's designed to be both a personal learning tool and a resource for others interested in following a similar learning path.

## Repository Structure

- **`memory-bank/`**: Documentation tracking learning progress, goals, and insights
  - Learning goals and milestones
  - Concept progress tracking
  - Project documentation
  - Technical context and environment setup
  - Overall progress metrics

- **`experiments/`**: Practical Rust code organized by application type and complexity
  - CLI Applications (basic â†’ advanced)
  - Packages & Libraries (API design, documentation, publishing)
  - Web Applications (servers, APIs, database integration)
  - Desktop & Mobile Applications (GUI, cross-platform, native integration)
  - Shared Components (reusable patterns across projects)

- **`docs/`**: Offline copies of essential Rust documentation
  - The Rust Programming Language Book
  - The Cargo Book
  - Other reference materials

## Learning Progression

The repository follows a deliberate learning path:

1. **CLI Applications**: Start with command-line tools to master Rust fundamentals
2. **Packages & Libraries**: Learn API design, documentation, and the module system
3. **Web Applications**: Explore async programming and network services
4. **Desktop & Mobile**: Tackle GUI development and platform-specific considerations

Each category contains multiple projects of increasing complexity, allowing for gradual skill development.

## Memory Bank System

A unique aspect of this project is the "Memory Bank" - a comprehensive documentation system that:

- Tracks learning goals and progress
- Documents concepts as they're learned
- Records project details and challenges
- Maintains technical context and environment details
- Captures learning patterns and preferences

This system ensures consistent progress tracking and creates a valuable reference for both personal use and others following along.
